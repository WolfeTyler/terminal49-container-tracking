# React + Mock Container Tracking API project

In this project, we're going to mock utilizing a container tracking API to render vessel tracing based on a user search.


* `package.json`: Configuration file for NPM, contains dependencies and project metadata
* `.gitignore`: Files that should be ignored by Git. `node_modules` can always be regenerated
* `public/index.html`: File that gets served thru Webpack after having been filled in
* `src/index.js`: This file is the entry point for the app. It puts our app on the screen!
* `src/components/*`: All the components of our application.
* `src/index.css`: The styles for our app. Check it out to see how your starter app is being styled, and add to it to complete the project. Notice that we don't `<link>` this CSS from the index? How does this work?? Make sure you understand!!!

**To get started coding on this project, remember the following steps**:
